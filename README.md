This project utilized data engineering/cleaning, data exploration, model fitting (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Boosted Trees), model stacking, and model analysis. 

The goal of this project was to predict whether a patient is at a high or low risk of a heart attack. This project was created by me and Michael Burns, UVA. We used the Kaggle dataset “Heart Attack Risk Analysis” which has medical and demographic information for over 7000 patients. The heart attack risk variable is the outcome and all others are predictors.
